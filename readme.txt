LCRChorus - a Left/Mid/Right Chorus effect made by Andrew Novitskiy using the iPlug framework.

This repo has the files that I worked on, not the entire iPlug framework.

Each Chorus has a depth, rate, and feedback modulation. Set the feedback to 100% for fun sounds!

A demo showing standard use of the plugin is at: https://youtu.be/aZ0xVTSou58

VST2 and exe included in output directory.
