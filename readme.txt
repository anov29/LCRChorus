LCRChorus - a Left/Mid/Right Chorus effect made by Andrew Novitskiy using the iPlug framework.

This repo has the files that I worked on, not the entire iPlug framework.

Each Chorus has a depth, rate, and feedback modulation. Set the feedback to 100% for fun sounds!

Watch me play around with the plugin at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBqBVL8XygI&feature=youtu.be 

VST2 and exe included in output directory.
